  <h1>Black Rock City Electronic Art Technical Support</h1>
  <img class="smallimage" src="/img/eats.svg" alt="logo">

  <p>We are a volunteer organization dedicated to providing assistance to
  artists whose installations make use of electronics, be it LED lighting,
  electromechanical servos, or electonic audio. If your art needs some
  troubleshooting be on the lookout for people with the above patch, and we will
  (possibly) help you.</p>

  <p>Also check out our <a href="{{ `guides` | relURL }}">Guides</a> to technical
  topics mostly related to electronic art.</p>
